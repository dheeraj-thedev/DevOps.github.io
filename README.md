## DevOps : I call it the bridge for the GAP between Development and Operation teams. For companies now a days, devops are set of practices to be in race to produce a feedback based solution.

To follow Agile practices I have enough applications like Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Google to talk about after interacting with they have proven themselves by delivering features over a period of time, they were able to evolve.

Today I would like to compare the development + Operation being handled by a team of 200 people in 2009 and nowadays the same 200 strength is handing it efficiently by practicing DevOps.

Consider the developer says: "In my machine, the feature is working fine, see the wynk attached why it is not working at your side ?".

it is not possible in today's modern software development practices.
